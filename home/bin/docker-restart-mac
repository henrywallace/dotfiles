# Docker For Mac seems to have intermittent problems with hanging forever since
# version 2.3, see [1]. The behavior is that containers can't be started, and
# currently running ones can't be stopped.
#
# To get around this we kill the entire Docker For Mac application. This script
# takes inspiration from [2].
