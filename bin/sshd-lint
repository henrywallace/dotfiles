#!/bin/sh

# This script performs a simple check on the current effective sshd_config. To
# execute on a remote server simply do `ssh host < sshd-lint`.
#
# If this script returns no errors, then the user SHOULD NOT necessarily
# consider their ssh server config to be free of vulnerabilities. Conversely,
# if it does output warnings, they may not be relevant to your situation.
#
# Before making changes to your /etc/ssh/sshd_config, make sure to validate it
# with `sshd -t`, before `systemctl restart sshd` or the like. Lest, experience
# the pain of dealing with a broken ssh server.
#
# Notes:
# - What about changing the default port? It's not checked in this script. This
#   can be called "security through obscurity" [2], and shouldn't be relied on by
#   "the enemy knows the system" principle [4]. But it could have benefits to See
#   [3] for a full explanation of why you might not want to change it.

# [1] The X11 protocol was never built with security in mind. As it opens up

# [1] By default, the SSH server can check if the client connecting maps back to
# the same combination of hostname and IP address. Use the option UseDNS to
# perform this basic check as an additional safeguard.

# [1] Instead of using a normal password-based login, a better way is using public
# key authentication. Keys are considered much safer and less prone to
# brute-force attacks. Disable PasswordAuthentication to force users using
# keys.

#   ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no host
